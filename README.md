#Operating:
 -A radar is a transmitter and receiver of electromagnetic or ultrasonic waves.
 -The radar emits a wave of any speed.
 -If the radar encounters no obstacle in its path, it continues to emit the waves.
 -If it detects an obstacle, the wave returns to the radar device.
 -It then measures the distance as well as the reaction time.
 
#Software:
 -Arduino IDE.
 -Processing Application.
